# Exponential and Geometric curves
The main aim of this Project is to find the best fit curve to a set of points using exponential and geometric curves.  
At first the desired equaiton is selected, then the values of x and y are inputed, the algoritm finds the best fit curve according to the selected equation
## Exponential curve
**y = a * e<sup>(b*x)</sup>**
## Geometric curves 
**1. y = a * b<sup>x</sup>**  
**2. y = a * x<sup>b</sup>**

>The visualisation of the curves might not be accurate in ipynb file, but the result is accurate upto 5th decimal place
